Rule Type: Manual

Defines how Cursor should behave as an assistant: task-by-task, no assumptions.


# ðŸ§  workflow-preferences.md â€“ AI Agent Behavior

## Task Execution
- Work only on one task at a time from TASKS.md
- After completing a task, stop and ask for confirmation before continuing
- If the PRD or task is unclear, ask for clarification

## Session & Alert Behavior
- Respect a 10-second slouch grace period before alerts
- Alerts must not block or pause the timer
- Respect user settings for nudge type (blink, sound, etc.)

## Development Safety
- Never touch `.env` or environment config files without explicit approval
- Do not change unrelated code or global logic outside current task scope

## Testing & Simulation
- Use dummy posture data during development (before MediaPipe is integrated)
- Clean up all test logic before merging or committing
- Do not include mock/fake data in production mode
